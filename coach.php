                <h2>Strength Training</h2>
                <p>
                    Strength training, also known as weight training or resistance training,<br>
                     is exercise designed to improve physical strength. It is <br>
                    often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate <br>
                    techniques such as bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, and squats),<br> 
                    isometrics (holding a position under tension, like planks), and plyometrics <br>
                    (explosive movements like jump squats and box jumps).<br>

                       Training works by progressively increasing the <br>
                       force output of the muscles and uses a<br>
                       variety of exercises and types of equipment.<br>
                       Strength training is primarily an<br>
                       anaerobic activity, although circuit training <br>
                       also is a form of aerobic exercise.<br>

                <h2>Yoga & Flexibility</h2>
                <p> Yoga and flexibility training are excellent additions<br>
                     to any fitness routine, especially for those focused on <br>
                     bodybuilding, as they aid in muscle recovery, injury<br>
                      prevention, and overall mobility. Incorporating yoga can <br>
                      help reduce muscle soreness, enhance blood flow, and improve<br>
                       joint stability and range of motion, ultimately <br>
                       preventing injuries. Additionally, it enhances posture<br>
                        and balance, contributing to better lifting form, while <br>
                        also strengthening the mind-body connection, improving focus, <br>
                        and relieving stress. Some of the best yoga poses for flexibility<br>
                         and recovery include Downward Dog, which stretches the <br>
                         , calves, and shoulders; Pigeon Pose, which opens up the<br>
                          hips and is particularly beneficial after leg workouts; <br>
                          Child’s Pose, which relaxes the lower back and shoulders;<br>
                           Cobra Pose, 
                    which stretches the abs and spine to promote better posture; <br>
                    and Seated Forward Fold, which increases hamstring and lower<br>
                     back flexibility.</p>

                      workout options that enhance overall fitness, endurance, and strength.<br>
                      **Zumba**, a dance-based cardio workout, improves cardiovascular health,<br> 
                      coordination, and agility while making exercise fun and engaging. **Aerobics**,<br>

                     and step workouts, boosts heart health, burns calories, and enhances<br>
                    stamina. **CrossFit**, a high-intensity functional training program,<br>
                          combines weightlifting, endurance exercises, and bodyweight movements<br> 
                          to build strength, power, and muscular endurance. Incorporating these <br>
                          workouts into a fitness routine can improve flexibility, balance,<br>

                <h2>Nutrition Counseling</h2>
                <p>Meal planning and diet consultation are essential for
                     maximizing gym performance, muscle growth,<br> 
                     and overall health. A well-structured diet provides the necessary 
                     macronutrients—protein for
                     <br> muscle repair, carbohydrates for energy, and healthy fats for 
                     recovery. Protein-rich foods<br> like chicken, eggs, fish, and legumes
                      help build and maintain muscle, while complex <br>carbs such as brown
                       rice, oats, and sweet potatoes fuel workouts. Healthy fats from sources 
                       <br>like avocados and nuts support hormone function and recovery. Proper meal
                        timing, <br>hydration, and portion control play a crucial role in achieving fitness
                         goals. Consulting a <br>nutritionist can help tailor a diet plan based on individual
                          needs, ensuring optimal 
                <br>performance and sustainable results.</p>
